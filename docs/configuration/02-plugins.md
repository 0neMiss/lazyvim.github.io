# Plugins

Configuring **LazyVim** plugins is exactly the same as using **lazy.nvim** to build
a config from scratch.

For the full plugin spec documentation please check the **lazy.nvim**
[readme](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

Refer to the **plugins** section in the sidebar for configuring
included plugins.
